# FloyTime

A very basic Java Game I invented to show how basic programming works. 

The gams consists in:
	- a 2D room with a window and a small container with some water
	- a fly flying aroud
	- try to get the fly into the container
	- position the container near the window
	- open the window ("S" key) and release the fly ("A" key)
	- close the window as soon as possible ("D" key)
	- when the window is open more flies might come in:)

A mad Game!!!:D

I coded it while being in a hostpital, and while at 1st year of university.

 NOTE: Full of bug to be solved by some java beginner:)

To run the java applet use the java appletviewer:
```
appletviewer FloyTime.html
```

Have fun and Cheers,
